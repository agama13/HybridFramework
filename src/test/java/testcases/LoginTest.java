/*
 * 
 *  OOPS Concepts Used In Framework - 
 *  
 *  We are using Inheritance using BaseClass
 *  
 *  Page Object Model - We are encapsulation where each locator is private and only that class methods can access the locators
 *  
 *  We have used Config Reader - which reads properties from property file or config file and we have used the values in framework at different places
 *  
 *  We have also created BrowserFactory which deals with Browser Invocation
 *  
 *  We have also added DataProvider in our test which takes data from excel and pass into our test methods
 *  
 *  We will add listeners 2 listeners 1-Listener which will capture the result of each test at run time
 *  
 *  2 listener which will be IRetryAnalyzer which will retry our test if it fails
